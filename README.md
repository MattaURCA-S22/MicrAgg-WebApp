First use the terminal to navigate into 'ma-app'

From there, you will need to install react the first time you do this, so type
'npm install --save react'

To stop the server, press Ctrl+C, then confirm with 'Y'

Pushing code is just like normal Git, so we'll want to setup dev branches for the future,
but to push to the online site on gh-pages, type 
'npm run deploy'
