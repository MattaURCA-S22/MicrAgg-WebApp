I've been looking into various video embed options, including hosting on YouTube, Vimeo, and locally.

Each has certain benefits and drawbacks. With YouTube it essentially impossible to prevent linking back to 
YouTube itself, and recommended videos will be shown after playback. It was also impossible to prevent 
users from making a video fullscreen on mobile. There will also likely be ads served to users.

Vimeo is an improvement, allowing for many links to the original page to be hidden, only leaving the vimeo 
logo in the bottom bar. There are are share and watch later buttons that cannot be removed. Some significant 
benefits are no ads and no suggested videos after playback. There is also paid options that allow the removal 
of the vimeo logo and watch later and share buttons, which would make this potentially the best option of all.

Local hosting has the advantage of more potential customization, though requires more work to potentially 
implement. While browsers have built in video players, there is more variety, which makes exact functionality 
less predictable unless a custom player were created. This option also requires local hosting, which is not just 
a storage concern, but a concern for bandwidth, especially if several users will take the survey simultaneously.
The videos would also need to be converted to multiple formats to support all browsers.

I've added some buttons to the UI, though there is no functionality to them yet, just styling
